North Korea has fired a missile into the Sea of Japan, with the latest provocative act from Pyongyang coming just days before US President Donald Trump meets his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

The Pentagon said North Korea had fired the missile at 6.42am local time on Wednesday and that it had landed in the sea nine minutes later. It said the rocket, believed to be a medium-range missile that could not reach the US, was fired from a land-based facility near Sinpo.

Seoul said the projectile, likely to be “a type of KN-15 medium-range ballistic missile”, also known as Pukguksong-2, travelled about 60km before landing in the sea.

The launch comes as Mr Trump prepares to host Mr Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in their first meeting. North Korea is expected to be one of the top issues on the agenda.
